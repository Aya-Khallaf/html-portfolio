<h1>The Best Movies According to Aya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I want to eat your pancreas</h3>
<p>Took me through a rollercoaster of emotions. It's a very sad anime movie, but it really leaves a mark.</p>

<h3>The Karate Kid</h3>
<p>It may be old, but it really hits hard and gives you a good action movie experience</p>

<h3>Puss in Boots - The Last Wish</h3>
<p>It had really good animation and an incredible story plot. Leaves you wondering how the movie will surprise you next.
    The antoganist was also very well structured. Many people say it may be one of the best villans.
